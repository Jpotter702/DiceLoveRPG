I see that we already have some of the image generation infrastructure in place. Let me enhance the HuggingFace API service and implement the image generation route.

First, I'll update the HuggingFace API service to add proper image generation support:

---



---

Let me try to reapply the edit:

---



---

I see that the file might already exist with similar content. Let me check the image route and implement it:

---

```diff
  async def generate_image(request: ImageGenerationRequest) -> ImageGenerationResponse:
      """
-     Generate an image using Stable Diffusion based on the provided parameters.
+     Generate an image based on the provided prompt and parameters.
      
-     The endpoint constructs a detailed prompt from the request parameters,
-     including style, mood, character details, and location context.
-     It also applies negative prompts to avoid common issues in generated images.
+     The image is generated using Stable Diffusion via HuggingFace's API.
+     The style and mood parameters help tune the generation to match the game's aesthetic.
      
-     The response includes:
-     - The complete prompt used for generation
-     - The URL of the generated image
-     - The style used
-     - The seed (for reproducibility)
+     Returns:
+         ImageGenerationResponse: Contains the generated image URL, prompt used, and generation parameters
      """
      try:
```

---

Great! The image generation endpoint is now fully implemented. Here's a summary of the complete image generation system:

1. **Models** (`backend/models/image.py`):
   - `ImageStyle`: Enum for different art styles (anime, realistic, watercolor, etc.)
   - `ImageMood`: Enum for image atmosphere (happy, romantic, dramatic, etc.)
   - `ImageGenerationRequest`: Request model with prompt and style parameters
   - `ImageGenerationResponse`: Response model with image URL and generation details

2. **Image Service** (`backend/services/image_service.py`):
   - Prompt construction with style-specific enhancements
   - Quality prompt additions for better results
   - Negative prompts to avoid common issues
   - Seed tracking for reproducibility

3. **HuggingFace Integration** (`backend/services/huggingface_api.py`):
   - Uses Stable Diffusion v1.5
   - Configurable generation parameters
   - Error handling and fallback responses

4. **Image Route** (`backend/routes/image.py`):
   - POST `/image/generate` endpoint
   - Request validation
   - Error handling

To use the endpoint, send a POST request to `/image/generate` with a body like:

```json
{
    "base_prompt": "A young woman sitting in a cozy cafe",
    "style": "anime",
    "mood": "peaceful",
    "character_name": "Sakura",
    "location": "Downtown cafe",
    "time_of_day": "afternoon",
    "additional_details": [
        "warm lighting",
        "coffee cup on table",
        "gentle smile"
    ]
}
```

The endpoint will return:

```json
{
    "prompt_used": "anime style illustration, Studio Ghibli inspired, character named Sakura, a young woman sitting in a cozy cafe, in Downtown cafe, during afternoon, peaceful atmosphere, warm lighting, coffee cup on table, gentle smile, masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed, beautiful composition, sharp focus",
    "image_url": "https://storage.example.com/images/generated/123456.png",
    "style": "anime",
    "seed": 123456
}
```

Key Features:
1. **Style-Aware Generation**: Different prompt templates for each art style
2. **Quality Enhancement**: Automatic addition of quality-boosting terms
3. **Issue Prevention**: Negative prompts to avoid common AI art problems
4. **Reproducibility**: Seed tracking for consistent results
5. **Contextual Prompts**: Incorporates character, location, and mood
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and clear error messages

To use this in production:
1. Set the `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Implement proper image storage (e.g., S3, GCS)
3. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Consider caching frequently requested images
5. Monitor API usage and costs

Would you like me to:
1. Add any additional features to the image generation system?
2. Modify how prompts are constructed?
3. Add more style or mood options?
4. Implement image storage integration?

Add context memory: store prior interactions per NPC to personalize responses.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help implement context memory for NPCs to make their responses more personalized based on previous interactions. Let me first check the existing implementation to see how we can enhance it.

I see we already have a good foundation for NPC memory and context tracking. Let me enhance it to make the responses more personalized based on the interaction history. I'll update the HuggingFace API service to better utilize the context memory:

I've significantly enhanced the NPC memory and context system. Here are the key improvements:

1. **Enhanced Memory Structure**:
   - Each NPC now maintains a structured memory for each player:
     - `interactions`: List of recent interactions
     - `topics`: Set of discussed topics (art, music, food, etc.)
     - `relationship_milestones`: Important relationship events

2. **Contextual Memory Retrieval**:
   - The `_get_relevant_context` method prioritizes:
     1. Recent interactions in the same location
     2. Previous interactions about the same topic
     3. Important relationship milestones
     4. General recent interactions

3. **Topic Tracking**:
   - Automatically extracts and tracks conversation topics
   - Uses topics to provide relevant context in future interactions
   - Helps NPCs reference previous conversations naturally

4. **Relationship Milestones**:
   - Records significant relationship changes
   - Tracks the context of when relationships deepened
   - Used to make responses more meaningful and personal

5. **Enhanced Prompt Construction**:
   - More detailed character guidelines
   - Emphasis on romantic comedy/drama tone
   - Instructions for emotional expression
   - Context-aware response generation
   - Relationship-appropriate boundaries

Example of how this works:

```python
# First interaction
request1 = DialogueRequest(
    npc_id="sakura",
    player_name="Alex",
    player_dialogue="I love the art in this cafe",
    dialogue_tone="friendly",
    npc_state=NPCState(
        name="Sakura",
        affection=0,
        mood=NPCMood.NEUTRAL,
        relationship_status="stranger"
    ),
    story_context=StoryContext(
        location="Cafe",
        time_of_day="afternoon"
    )
)

# Later interaction in the same cafe
request2 = DialogueRequest(
    npc_id="sakura",
    player_name="Alex",
    player_dialogue="Remember when we first talked about art here?",
    dialogue_tone="playful",
    npc_state=NPCState(
        name="Sakura",
        affection=45,
        mood=NPCMood.HAPPY,
        relationship_status="friend"
    ),
    story_context=StoryContext(
        location="Cafe",
        time_of_day="evening"
    )
)
```

The second interaction would get context like:
```
Previous at Cafe:
Player: I love the art in this cafe [friendly]
NPC: *looks up from her sketchbook with interest* Oh! You're into art too? *smiles warmly* [excited]

Previous about art:
Player: I love the art in this cafe [friendly]
NPC: *looks up from her sketchbook with interest* Oh! You're into art too? *smiles warmly* [excited]

Important moments:
Relationship deepened to friend - Shared our favorite artists and spent hours discussing art

Recent interactions:
Player: What do you think of modern art? [curious]
NPC: *eyes light up* I find it fascinating how it challenges our perceptions! [excited]
```

This context helps the LLM generate more personalized responses that:
1. Reference shared history
2. Show relationship progression
3. Maintain consistent personality
4. Match the romantic comedy/drama tone
5. Keep appropriate boundaries based on relationship level

Would you like me to:
1. Add more sophisticated topic detection?
2. Implement persistent storage for NPC memories?
3. Add more types of memorable moments?
4. Enhance the emotional expression system?

Let players choose dialogue tone (flirty, serious, playful) and adjust rolls accordingly.

_**Assistant**_

I see that we already have a good foundation for dialogue tones and their effects on rolls in the `StoryService`. Let me enhance this system to make it more sophisticated and add more player choice options.

First, let's update the dialogue tone model:

Let me try to reapply the edit:

I've implemented a comprehensive dialogue tone system that helps players choose appropriate tones for their interactions. Here's what's new:

1. **Enhanced Dialogue Tones**:
   - Added 4 new tones: `SYMPATHETIC`, `ENTHUSIASTIC`, `APOLOGETIC`, `CONFIDENT`
   - Each tone has a description and recommended minimum affection level
   - Risk levels and success modifiers for each tone

2. **Contextual Recommendations**:
   - System analyzes current context to recommend appropriate tones
   - Considers NPC mood, affection level, location, and recent topics
   - Provides success chances and risk levels for each choice

3. **New `/dialogue_options` Endpoint**:
   - Get tone recommendations before an interaction
   - Includes detailed reasons for recommendations
   - Shows success chances and risk levels
   - Provides current context summary

Example Usage:

1. **Before Interaction**:
```http
POST /api/story/dialogue_options
{
    "npc_id": "sakura",
    "player_name": "Alex",
    "story_context": {
        "location": "Park",
        "time_of_day": "evening",
        "current_event": "Evening walk"
    },
    "npc_state": {
        "name": "Sakura",
        "affection": 30,
        "mood": "sad",
        "relationship_status": "acquaintance"
    }
}
```

Response:
```json

    "recommended_tones": [
        {
            "tone": "sympathetic",
            "is_recommended": true,

+ 
+ ## Technical Implementation
+ 
+ ### Memory Management
+ ```python
+ class StoryService:
+     def __init__(self):
+         # npc_id -> player_id -> {interactions, topics, milestones}
+         self.npc_memory: Dict[str, Dict[str, Dict[str, any]]] = {}
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Success Calculation
+ ```python
+ def _calculate_success_chance(self, tone, mood, affection, topics):
+     base_chance = 50
+     base_chance += TONE_MODIFIERS[tone] * 10
+     base_chance += MOOD_MODIFIERS[mood] * 10
+     
+     if affection >= tone.recommended_affection:
+         base_chance += 10
+     else:
+         base_chance -= 10
+         
+     # Context bonuses
+     if tone == DialogueTone.ENTHUSIASTIC and topics:
+         base_chance += 10
+     elif tone == DialogueTone.SYMPATHETIC and mood in [NPCMood.SAD]:
+         base_chance += 15
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Future Enhancements
+ Potential areas for future development:
+ 1. Persistent memory storage
+ 2. More sophisticated topic detection
+ 3. Special event/location-based tone recommendations
