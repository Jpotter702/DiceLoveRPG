# Love & Geist: A Dating Sim with AI-Powered NPCs

## Overview
Love & Geist is a unique dating simulation game that combines traditional dating sim mechanics with modern AI technology to create dynamic, engaging character interactions. The game features intelligent NPCs powered by HuggingFace's language models, a sophisticated affection system, and context-aware dialogue choices.

- **Geist System**: Dynamic probability-based action resolution system
- **Affection Points (AP)**: Track and evolve relationships with NPCs
- **AI-Generated Images**: Character and scene visualization using Stable Diffusion

### Advanced Interaction System
- **Context Memory**: NPCs remember past interactions and shared experiences
- **Dynamic Dialogue**: 10 distinct dialogue tones with context-aware recommendations
- **Emotional Expression**: NPCs respond with realistic emotions and actions
- **Relationship Progression**: Natural relationship development based on interactions

### AI Integration
- **Smart Responses**: AI-generated dialogue tuned for romantic comedy/drama
- **Contextual Memory**: NPCs reference past conversations and shared interests
- **Personality Consistency**: Characters maintain consistent traits while evolving
- **Emotional Depth**: Realistic emotional responses based on relationship status
